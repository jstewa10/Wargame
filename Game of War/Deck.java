   modified for Game of War by Jaired Stewart 
   Modifications:
   -cardsInDeck now a private int instead of a constant as in war a deck might have more than 52 Cards
   -new Contstant named STANDARD_DECK for freshDeck method
   -copy constructor that accepts a deck of any size 
   -constructor that creates an empty deck of a given size
   -freshDeck changed since my card class had different constants
